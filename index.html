        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language.</li>
          <li>HTML is a type of markup language used in the creation of webpages and web applications.</li>
          <li>HTML consists of elements or tags that make up both the structure and content of a webpage.</li>
          <li>HTML tags are enclosed by angle brackets (i.e., < >).</li>
          <li>HTML attributes provide supplementary information about an element.</li>
          <li>HTML is structured into different sections, such as the head and body elements, which both play significant roles in the composition of a webpage.</li>
          <li>The head element contains inforamtion about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
          <li>CSS is linked within the head element of an HTML file using the "link" tag.</li>
          <li>CSS is used to define formatting and styling rules for elements of a webpage.</li>
          <li>Rules define colours, asthetics, visual layout, and organization of elements on a webpage. </li>
          <li>There are three different ways to style with CSS: Inline CSS, Internal CSS, and External CSS.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Inline CSS styles directly in an HTML tag using a style attribute.</li>
            <li>Internal CSS embeds a style sheet in the head section of an HTML file using the style element.</li>
            <li>External CSS creates a separate CSS document with the styling rules, which is then linked to the HTML file using the link element in the head section of the HTML file.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>CSS rule consists of a selector, which defines the element or attribute, and declarations, which specify the property and value to be applied.</li>  
          <li>CSS declarations are enclosed by curly brackets (i.e., { }).</li>
          <li>The margin property specifies the amount of space wanted outside of an element.</li>
          <li>The padding property specifies the amount of space wanted around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>CSS uses the * selector to apply rules to all elements displayed on a page.</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="card" id="git-section">
        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Git is a version control system.</li>
          <li>Git allows developers to undo changes and return to a previous version.</li>
          <li>Git allows developers to collaborate remotely without overwriting each other's work.</li>
          <li>Some common examples of git commands include:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>git config --global user.name "[your name]": set up a name of the person writing the code</li>
              <li>git config --global user.email "[valid-email]": set up an email address</li>
              <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
              <li>git branch: provides a list of all the branches in the repository</li>
              <li>git checkout [branch-name]: switch to another branch</li>
              <li>git checkout -b [branch-name]: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
              <li>git add -A: adds all modifications in the current branch to the staging area</li>
              <li>git commit -m "[descriptive message]": commit content in the staging area with a message</li>
              <li>git pull: sync local branch with the remote branch (i.e., merge the most up-to-date commits from remote branch to local)</li>
              <li>git push: update local commits with the remote branch (i.e., transmit local commits to the remote repo branch)</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript is a high-level programming language that provides logic and interactivity for webpages.</li>
          <li>JavaScript is linked in either the head or the body element of an HTML file using the "script" tag.</li>
          <li>JavaScript is case sensitive.</li>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>JavaScript has a number of fundamental data types, such as number, string, boolean, undefined, null, and symbol, as well as a single non-primitive data type known as object.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Number represents numeric data.</li>
            <li>String represents sequence of text values enclosed in single ('') or double quotes ("").</li>
            <li>Boolean represents logical values that can be either true or false.</li>
            <li>Undefined represents a variable in absence of a value.</li>
            <li>Null represents the absence of an object.</li>
            <li>Symbol, also known as atoms, represents an unique identifier.</li>
            <li>Object represents a collection of data, functions, properties and more.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>JavaScript executes code from top to bottom unless interrupted by conditional statements, loops, or function calls.</li>
          <li>In conditional statements, we check to see if the condition is falsy (i.e., 0, -0, 0n, "", null, undefined, NaN, or false) or  truthy (i.e.,true; all other values that were not listed for falsy).</li>
          <li>The Strict Equality Operator (===) evaluates whether two values are equal and returns a true or false result.</li>
          <li>An array is a variable that represents a collection of related elements or data.</li>
          <li>An array can store different types of data in a single variable.</li>
          <li>The elements within an array can be accessed using their array index, also known as the location number or location identifier.</li>
          <li>Arrays are zero-indexed and sequential, which means that the first item in any array starts with 0, followed by a predictable pattern of 1, 2, 3, and so on.</li>
          <li>The "for" loop is commonly used with the predictable pattern of indices to perform a repeated task for each element in the array.</li>
          <li>The "for" loop consists of 3 statements: the starting point of the loop, the condition that must be true for the loop to continue, and the statement that updates the loop variable on each iteration.</li>
          <li>Commenting Out Code (/* code block */) inactivates code without deleting it.</li>
          <li>Function is a set of instructions of a task.</li>
          <li>JavaScript functions involve two main steps: defining the function with instructions, and then calling it to execute those instructions.</li>
          <li>JavaScript function declaration (or the function definition) consists of a name followed by parentheses (), and a code block enclosed in curly brackets {}.</li>
          <li>The function will not execute its code until we call it.</li>
